TODO's:


1) ClankerCraft:

 - Language settings --> automatically switch language for the clanker based on 'language setting' in properties or something. 
Has to adjust the standard sentences in 'ChatInteraction.java' & make sure the LLM (and TTS) respond in the right language (personality texts might need to be adjusted too)

 - Prevent TTS from pronouncing symbols like '*' etc. 


                   *** Nice to haves ***

 - ? Maybe find a way to improve the texture reload (F3+T), but automatically reloading is not that niceee :(

 - ? Right now AI paintings & music discs overwrite existing painting and disc (4x4 'pointer' painting & disc '13' respectively). This allows for just one generation for each, so maybe allow for multiple generations/variants and custom painting sizes (2x2, 4x2 etc.)  

 - ? Maybe spawn Clankers naturally in villages or some shit --> maybe with different personalities (and appearance using oxidation levels for the copper golem?) 

 - ? Maybe Fix Clanker spawn egg textures (nice to have, doesn't matter that much) 

 - ? When a session is ended during conversation and player spawns back in, the mob remains frozen (but not in conversation). 




2) Assignment
